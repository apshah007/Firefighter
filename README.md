Used amazon developer website to program skills for Alexa.  Created flash briefings for Office of Women, Mayor's Healthy Hometown, Louisville City Events as skills that Alexa can report on using Louisville Civic Data.  This website has the civic data: https://louisvilleky.gov/services/departments_list.json?limit=0     This is an example of how the url looked like to use the data from
the civic data website: https://louisvilleky.gov/government/10241/news/feed   These skills were created as part of Civic Data Hackathon on March 4, 2017 for the City of Louisville.
